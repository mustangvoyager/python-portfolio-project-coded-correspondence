# python-portfolio-project-coded-correspondence

This project uses old-fashioned ciphers for the purpose of extensively exploring **lists** and list manipulation through **indexing**. Code organization, problem solving, and writing efficient code were very central to this code development. I worked independently (without code solutions) while incorporating new Python language learnings.

The codebase here includes an interactive notebook (Jupyter, Version: 7.0.3), a `.py` file (Python, Version: 3.11.5), and an executable. Here are some of the mechanics you'll find in the code:

* Code to solve a Caesar Cipher
* Then some code to encode a message, along with test code.
* Most of the code above was then encapsulated as two separate functions to decode and encode. The decode function is then used to guess a Caesar Cipher shift value via brute force.
* Lastly I wrote code for a Vigenère Cipher (polyalphabetic substitution cipher). This is used to encode then decode some song lyrics using the keyword `minnie` in honor of Memphis Minnie (1897-1973).

This was fun! Details of these encryption/decryption algorithms are explained in the notebook’s markdown.
